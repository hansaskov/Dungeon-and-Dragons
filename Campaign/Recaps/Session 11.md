Continued from [[Session 10]]]

## Displacer fight
The Session starts out by the party fighting 3 displacer beasts in an ambush. Through the fight they make use of their different tools, such as the decoy duck which was not confiscated at the forest edge, which started a small fire on one of the trees. The party efficiently fought the displacer beasts while the fire slowly spread. At the end part of the fight, [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]] used his ever smoke bottle to try and snuff out the flames, it completely covered the area in thick smoke, which started killing the fire, but made it easy for the last displacer beast to escape. To try and stop this, [[Luffy Longfinger]] used a scroll of anything, to try and stop it, which made a giant gust of wind blow a hole through the smoke, but made the fire increase in size. After the displacer beast escaped, the party stopped the fire and returned with 2 displacer beast bodies in good condition. 

## Sutton evening
Back at [[Sutton]], the party met with the rangers, who skinned the beasts for them, Luffy chose to try and learn the craft of skinning beasts, while the other 2 went down into the town. Caelum found a blacksmith and asked about the ring they had found. They were told that the tavern keeper might know something about it.

After some time the beasts were skinned and the party gained 4 leather pieces, a small amount of teeth and claws, and bought some of the meat from the rangers, so they could try and have the tavern make some food for them with it. Luffy sadly did not learn how to properly skin, but bought another lesson from them after dinner, when the rest of the rangers returned from the forest.
At the tavern, they talked with the tavern keep about the food and Luffy tried to have them make a meat and bread dish he though sounded good, and called it a [[Burger]]. To be more precise, a [[Mist or beast burger]]. Though interesting the party ultimately decided to have the house special with their meat cooked as is.

After dinner the party relaxed in town for a bit, and Luffy went and learned skinning. 
After a long rest the morning after, the party started to head back to [[EverBrook]].

Which is where the session ended.
