Continued from [[Session 5]]

## Nexus research and shopping
With the continuance of their research at [[The Nexus]], [[Luffy Longfinger]] looking for a book about becoming a better servant, accidentally encounters a being looking like a book, which quickly sprouts wings and forms into a dragon-like being. It flies from his grasp and into another bookshelf, where it quickly becomes a book once more. Giving up on the book, he chooses to meet up with [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]] once more. 
He found the dwarf engrossed in a tome titled *Divine Interventions*, a book detailing historical curses and plagues. With only a couple of hours before their servant try-outs, **Borgemir** quickly skimmed through the book to try and find anything worth while, where he found and read "The Plague of Shadow Nightmares", "The Prank of Fading Memory" and "Devil’s Oblivion". Where, despite not finding a direct correlation to his problem, he learned that people of the church might be of some help to him. While **Borgemir** was reading, **Luffy** asked scholars about the existence of rare fruits that could grant a person extraordinary powers. The scholar confirmed that while such things were possible, special abilities were more commonly the result of divine boons, blessings, or curses, and could manifest in countless ways.

While the two researched, [[Caelum Aequoris]] got his crossbow and went to [[Blast's Magic Emporium]] for more scrolls, and to incur him about information on the red orb they had lost. Blast agreed to use his contacts and research networks to investigate the crystal, though he admitted he had no immediate knowledge of such an artifact. Blast assured **Caelum** that he would reach out through magical communication once his research was complete.

## Servant try-outs
After reading at the Nexus, **Luffy** and **Borgemir** travelled to [[The Mirage]] for the try-outs. on the way they discussed last night's attack again. Mainly on how **Luffy** might be turning into a vampire from his death and resurrection. Mainly joking with how he couldn't see his reflection or how the sun where hotter than usual, even though he physically felt no different, and where properly just overthinking things. Arriving at The Mirage, **Caelum** where waiting on them, almost falling asleep due to his exhaustion, but he told the other two about his deal with Blast while the other two updated him on their findings. 
With the try-outs soon starting the party entered The Mirage, where they informed the guard of their business and entered the main hall. Here a busy hall with multiple tables setup with several distinguished-looking patrons placed at them, and Arianna directing staff to ensure the tests where ready. They inform her that they arrived, and are directed to the waiting area with the other applicants. **Caelum** spots [[Gaelana]] and her band preparing to play for the try-out, and joins them without much question from the band, since it would be a good training opportunity, before the main event. 
Arianna clapped her hands, calling all thirty applicants to attention. She formally welcomed the "waiters-to-be," explaining they had been invited based on recommendations or for demonstrating other "important abilities." She laid out the trial: a series of three tasks designed to test their suitability for [[The Mirage]]. They would be judged on their ability to take orders from the distinguished patrons in the room, the efficiency of their delivery, and, most importantly, their customer service. "We are a high-prestige establishment," she stressed, "It is vital that you can project the proper image of The Mirage."

staff members moved through the crowd, assigning each applicant a number corresponding to a table of judges. **Borgemir** was given number seven a table with a energetic human kid and his mother, and **Luffy** received number fifteen a table with a older couple of the halfling race. All while **Caelum** prepared to play the chosen songs for the day's event.
With the try-out started **Borgemir** masterly remembered the menu, gave good recommendations, and delivered the ordered food and drinks all while giving a charming costumer service, a complete 180 from his normal personality. All while **Luffy** bumbled a bit through the service, forgetting one of the drinks they had ordered, but delivered the rest on time and was able to quickly get the forgotten drink, and by giving a good customer service, all did not seem to be lost for him.
Performing beautifully, under the try-out **Caelum** showed that he was more than capable to play at the VIP event, but with the immense physical and mental strain of the past 48 hours, the stress of the performance, combined with his complete lack of sleep, took a severe toll, and he was struck by another wave of debilitating exhaustion.
With the trail ended Arianna and the judges tallied the scores, and both **Borgemir** and Luffy **had** passed the trial. **Borgemir**, had passed with flying colours, while **Luffy**, true to his form, had just barely scraped by.
They were then informed that they are to arrive at 14:00 the next day to help prepare the last things for the event. And as they departed, each was given an official staff badge for [[The Mirage]]—**Caelum**'s identifying him as a "Performer," and the others' as "Server."

## The night goes on
With the night still young and the VIP event not until the following evening, **Luffy** suggested they unwind by visiting a familiar bar in the Forest Way district— [[The Floating Chair]] where **Caelum** had previously been offered a gig and they had discovered a underground fight pit. The idea was met with concern for **Caelum**, who was swaying on his feet from the sheer exhaustion of having been awake for over 48 hours, but **Borgemir** that he would carry the bard on his back, allowing him to sleep on the journey there, which he agreed to. They ventured to the bar, but were interrupted by a street vendor, selling mysterious exotic fruits of every imaginable shape and colour. **Luffy** ended up buying one.
At [[The Floating Chair]], the party gave **Caelum** some liquor to try and keep him awake, and he agreed to play for a bit for some cash. While he played **Luffy** and **Borgemir** spoke with the bartender about the fighting pit. They learned that the next event was a large, bracket-style tournament scheduled for the following week, not an impromptu brawl for that evening. **Borgemir** noticed that he had to go for the meeting he had setup at [[Copperbreath]] inn and left the other two, but not before **Luffy** could establish a telepathic connection. At [[Copperbreath]] inn he met with [[Thorim Daybreaker]], who he laid out a business proposition: Borgemir and his companions would fight underground fights, while he would find and set up these fight for them. The tense negotiation was repeatedly and bizarrely interrupted by telepathic messages from **Luffy**, painting a picture of utter chaos back at The Floating Chair. **Borgemir** received live updates about a beautiful dwarf woman buying shots for the entire bar, **Caelum**’s weary music transforming into energetic house music, the same woman now dancing on the tables, and another patron casting *magic missile* spells to create a makeshift light show. The tavern had, in the span of thirty minutes, devolved into a full-blown rave.
At the end the two dwarfs found a common ground and an even 50/50 partnership were made. 
The meeting was brought to an abrupt conclusion by one last, frantic telepathic update from **Luffy**. The wild party at [[The Floating Chair]] had reached its chaotic peak: the beautiful dwarf woman who had been buying drinks for the bar was now dancing naked on the tables, reportedly sporting more chest hair than **Borgemir** himself. This was enough for the paladin to wrap things up. Back at the tavern, the rave was unceremoniously ended when the same woman began vomiting, instantly killing the festive atmosphere.
With the party over, everyone went to [[Embers Complex]] to sleep.

## The VIP event preparations
The next day, they met shortly with [[Valarie River]] to update her on the mission, and she endorsed the idea. To aid their infiltration, she provided them with valuable tools from her own stash: a single Potion of Invisibility and two Scrolls of Sending. 
The plan was now for **Luffy** to drink the Potion of Invisibility and slip away during the festivities at [[The Mirage]] to search Milton's private office, while **Borgemir** would cover for him. 
Arriving early at [[The Mirage]] the party scouted the outside, noticing that the rotating guards left a opening at the left side of the building every half hour for around a minute. 
Entering [[The Mirage]] they met with Arianna who told them that their shift would start in around 15 min, but they were welcome to start earlier. They party used this time to explore some of the top floor, which were restricted to staff members. They found room labelled "staff office" and "milton's office", and they went through the staff office. They met a halfling woman who were updating a ledger for the event, but not much else of interest, since they could not do a thorough search with her in the room.
The party made an elaborate plan trying to get **Luffy** on the roof, using either a ladder or the "whirlwind ale" from the bar, so he could sneak into **Milton**'s office, but were unable to find a direct way to the roof.
Realizing their shift was about to begin, the party went to report to Arianna. The servers were set to work, carring wine into the vaults / cellar, while **Caelum** waited for the rest of the band to arrive.
Which is were the session ended.
