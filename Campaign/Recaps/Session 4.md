Continued from [[Session 3]].
### Sewer aftermath 
After the fight in the sewers with the wight, the party searches the area, where [[Caelum Aequoris]] finds a small drawing from a child, on one of the zombie bodies. [[Lorian]] checking the wight together with [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]], notes that these beings being in the city is highly irregular, and that they normally only are found in cursed lands. Especially since they often are made from dark powers or by high necromancers. [[Lorian]] chooses to go back to [[Embers Complex]] and report, before heading back to [[Forrestway]] to try and find more. 

Meanwhile **Borgemir** and **Caelum** chooses to look further into the sewer where the zombies came from, and finds a small dark room with a glowing red crystal in it. Surrounding it, lays 4 shrunken bodies, looking lifeless. **Caelum** decides to take a closer look at the crystal while **Borgemir** checks the bodies. **Caelum** notices that the crystal is brimming with life energy, and simply by touching it, he feels more alive and renewed. Meanwhile **Borgemir** checking the bodies quite roughly, accidently kills the halfdead man he finds. **Caelum** decides to take the crystal, and him and **Borgemir** tries to resuscitate the now dead man. They try to use a Scroll of anything, which knocks **Borgemir** and the body into a wall, effectively removing any chance of saving him. They thereafter start heading back to Clara, but **Caelum** suddenly feels watched, but have no notion of wherefrom. The feeling disappears after a bit, and he does not tell anyone.
Meanwhile [[Luffy Longfinger]] was training with [[Flint Varn]], before meeting up with the team at Clara's. He learns that [[Flint Varn]] was a veteran who had fought with the [[Truth Breakers]] for a long time, and even had been to [[The Empire]] to fight in wars, to further increase the network of the [[Truth Breakers]]. He travels to Clara's where he is debriefed by Clara and [[Lorian]], before meeting up with the party. The party comes back all grimy and dirty, making them want a short break. While they clean and rest up, **Luffy** says that he would head to the sewers himself, but in reality ends up going to a bar called [[The Floating Chair]]. At this bar he talks with a bartender, who quickly shows that he is racist towards dwarfs. He talks with **Luffy** for a while, and they end up hitting it off. Before **Luffy** leaves, the bartender invites him to a underground fighting tournament happening in a few weeks, and that he should just meet up with him and his team if he wants in.
**Luffy** joins back with the party and shares some of the things he found, such as the bar wanting to hire a musician if possible.
### To The Mirage
The party talks about what to do, and decides to go look for [[Milton Pennywise]] to see if he has any connection with [[Harold Jamish]]'s disappearance. They choose to go along the denser city area, where [[Forrestway]] and [[StarCrest District]] meets. The travel goes without any problems, until they get to the beginning of [[StarCrest District]], where they are stopped by 2 guards, since they where **Caelum and Borgemir** where walking very suspiciously down a side road. After trying to convince that they are not suspicious and failing to do so, they are checked for contraband.
Meanwhile, since **Luffy** were not seen as suspicious he darts down a side road, and tries to use a scroll of anything to see if he can get any help. The scroll suddenly makes all his silver double, making him a double as rich as before, but sadly not helping the situation.
**Borgemir** is searched and nothing illegal is found. But when they look through **Caelum**'s bag, they find the disguise kit, which is confiscated, and soon after sees the red glowing crystal. They immediately become weary and get ready to arrest **Caelum**, but by some miracle, he convinces them that he is on a secret mission to deliver the crystal to the church, and that they should act as if nothing was out of the ordinary.
Being convinced of this, the guards leave them alone, and the party continues onwards. 
After a bit the party starts to see more shops and less residential buildings. They also notice more carriages traveling the road. Most being from the [[Pennywise family]]. **Luffy** asks around in a general shop owned by [[Milton Pennywise]], about **Milton** and learn that he runs the biggest casino in [[Forrestway]], called [[The Mirage]]. Fearing that they are not dressed well enough to sneak into the casino, **Caelum** enters a clothing store, while **Luffy and Borgemir** searches the trash bins of the shop. **Caelum** is thoroughly embarrassed and humiliated by the snubby clerk ridiculing him for his style, clothes and money, while **Borgemir** finds a leather coat and some fine looking pants, if they are washed, while **Luffy** sadly finds nothing. Using these new clothes the party goes to [[The Mirage]] and enters without being seen by the guards.
### At The Mirage
Entering [[The Mirage]] they are met with a grand set of stairs leading into a grand hall of games music and light. **Luffy** quickly starts gambling, while **Caelum** goes to one of the live bands and listens to them sing. **Borgemir** end up following **Luffy** after a short while. Playing the game called Gyp, **Luffy** quickly uses his charlatans die to cheat, and is able to do so without being noticed, and earning a bit of money. Meanwhile, **Borgemir** tries to talk with one of the dwarfs at the table, and ends in doing a side bet with him in seeing who can roll highest. Unable to notice that the dwarf called [[Thorim Daybreaker]] was also cheating, **Borgemir** quickly lost twice, before loosing most of his money. But during the last game, both **Luffy** and **Thorim** where caught cheating, loosing their die's. Angry **Thorim** wants his money from **Borgemir**, but he is unable to pay and tries to walk away. This quickly escalates into a fight, which is taken to **The Pits**. The two dwarves find an empty ring, and starts fighting, while **Luffy** bets on **Borgemir** winning. The fight starts out by them hitting and throwing each other, but quickly becomes much more violent, when **Borgemir** throws his hat, misses his attack and the hat is taken by **Thorim**. **Borgemir** sees red, and the fight escalates. **Luffy** trying to help, tries to distract the ref but without any luck. The fight gets out of hand where they start kicking, spitting and throwing each other, until **Thorim** is thrown into the wooden railing, where the two is unable to land any prober hits. It ends with **Thorim** using a scroll of anything which was given to him by **Luffy** before the fight, giving him the insight into magic by giving him a lvl 2 spell slot spell for the first time in his life. **Borgemir** using this, grabs one of **Thorim**'s nuts and rips it off, making him pass out and making **Borgemir** win the fight.
Meanwhile all of this was happening, **Caelum** tried flirting for the first time. Listening to the band and the singer, he noticed that he knew a good amount of the songs, especially one about the rough seas down south where he came from. During a break he invites the main singer, a half-elf woman to a drink, which she accepts. They talk and share stories while they share a **Crystal song gin**. She shares that her name is [[Gaelena]] and that she also came from the south, from a small town on the coast, and that she had been to his home town island before. Sadly **Caelum** unable to keep the conversation going, slowly bores her, and she starts heading back to the band. But before leaving **Caelum** convinces her to let him sing a song or two on his flute with them. Upon entering the stage, he plays amazing, and from what it looks like **Gaelena** starts warming up to him again.

Which is where the session ends.
