Continued from [[Session 4]]

In the aftermath of the pits [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]] was victorious, following the brutal hand to hand combat, ending in **Thorim** being maimed. Winning 10 G and some prestige in [[The Mirage]], meanwhile [[Luffy Longfinger]] won a good amount on betting for **Borgemir** to win.
Meanwhile [[Caelum Aequoris]] was performing beautifully with **Shorelined**, where his talents where recognised and [[Gaelana]] invited him to join them in a performance 2 days from now, in the VIP section. This represented a crucial breakthrough, as the band would be performing at an exclusive gathering that [[Milton Pennywise]] himself would attend. 
During this, **Luffy** and **Borgemir** celebrated at one of the bars, where **Luffy** got a Whirlwind ale, making him lighter and able to jump around like never before. Using this boost, he quickly ran to the bathroom and stole a silver ring with a small amber engraved into it. **Luffy** would thereafter find **Caelum** where he was told of the VIP event, and **Luffy** was invited as a server, after a meeting with the head of staff **Arianna**. They were brought upstairs to the Staff and VIP sections, where they met with **Arianna**, and due to **Luffy**'s lack of formal training he was to join a servers try-outs for new hires that would happen the next day around the afternoon. During their tour of the VIP areas, the party discovered the layout they would need to navigate: an intimate gaming room where guests would mingle, and an adjoining performance space housing exquisite musical instruments and a premium bar stocked with expensive spirits. **Arianna** explained that if **Luffy** secured his position, he would serve drinks to guests while **Caelum** performed with the band during opening and closing ceremonies.
## Celebration for the times ahead
Meanwhile **Borgemir** was celebrated by different people who had seen the fight, but feeling that things were not done, between him and [[Thorim Daybreaker]] he sought him out, first looking through The pits, before learning that a inn on the other side of the street had a collaboration with [[The Mirage]], where they would take care of the injured at their infirmary. He went to the tavern with an expensive ale he got on the house, and asked where he would find **Thorim**. After meeting him at the infirmary, and scaring the life out of him, by seeking him out after giving him life long trauma, he suggested that they would share the ale. Very uncertain **Thorim** took the ale, which had a cleansing effect on both, which made him presumably trust **Borgemir** a bit more. **Borgemir** then invited him to **[[Copperbreath]]** the next evening, which he accepted.
Retuning to [[The Mirage]], following their successful negotiations, the party celebrated with **Galena**'s band. The evening escalated dramatically when the drummer, **Raylem**, introduced a potent black liquor called "[[Death Spirit]]." While **Galena** and the guitarist immediately collapsed unconscious for a short while from the drink, both **Caelum** and **Luffy** displayed remarkable constitution experiencing waves of pure euphoria.
**Borgemir** later arrived and regaled the party with the story of his arena victory - complete with producing the severed testicle as proof - **Raylem** loved the story and welcomed him into the party. The celebration continued until a very drunk **Caelum** attempted to immortalize the victory in song, only to slip on spilled ale and crash onto a table. The bar keep, having reached his limit with the rowdy patrons, shut them off the alcohol.
## Taking back what is theirs
After partying for many hours, it had become dark and a heavy rain and thunder had come over [[Forrestway]]. Due to the heavy rain and amount of drinking they had done, they struggled finding a way back to [[Embers Complex]] for a nights rest. With **Caelum** at the helm for finding home, they ended up becoming completely lost, and ending in some unknown part of [[Forrestway]]. They found a small shabby inn, where they chose to rest instead, where they got a room for the night and quickly fell asleep.
While resting at a shabby inn, they were ambushed in the dead of night by three mysterious figures who moved with supernatural speed and instilled a paralyzing fear in most of the party. The attackers - led by a elf in a clean porcelain mask, with a small rose on the side, accompanied by a small girl in a owl-mask and a man in a wolf mask towered over the frightened party. The porcelain masked elf was drawn to the backpack of [[Caelum Aequoris]], and without issue found the red glowing orb. He gave a quick chuckle, that they hadn't even tried to use the power held by the orb. While inspecting the orb he ordered the other two to "clean up" the pests, where they, in a blink of an eye, appeared around [[Luffy Longfinger]]. The wolf skewered him through his back with a icy cold sword, while the owl split his chest in two quick slashes, killing him on the spot before the party could react. The porcelain elf stood with the artifact and small red tendrils appeared and connected to his arm, before disappearing again, all while **Caelum** could do nothing but stare at him, locked by his instinctual fear. [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]] was able to overcome the dread imposed on him, and seeing his friend killed in front of him, made him jump at the owl masked girl, but mid jump he was suddenly stopped and felt an iron grip around his throat. The porcelain masked elf held him up from the ground and stared at him, first with the look and feel of disgust, but then. interest. He brought him a bit closer, studying him, before giving a slight smile and saying "interesting... but why though. Why where you marked?" Before throwing him back into his bed. He then turned to his two allied and stated that they would leave. The owl masked girl seamed annoyed by this, but followed. The elf then held the orb and pointed it towards **Luffy** where red motes flew from the orb and into **Luffy**. Before long **Luffy**'s wounds began closing and he came back to life. The attackers then vanished as mysteriously as they had appeared, dissolving into smoke and escaping through the shattered window. They left behind a traumatized party and more questions than answers, taking the mysterious crystal with them. 
## Rest and research
The attack left the party psychologically scarred but determined to understand their enemies. Caelum, too terrified to sleep, maintained a vigilant watch through the night while his companions recovered from their ordeal. The next morning found them back at their hideout, where they carefully went through the hideout, since it felt like no one where home. Getting to the operations room, they finally met [[Seth Stones]], who looked annoyed at **Caelum** and **Borgemir** while looking favourably towards **Luffy**. They asked for the whereabouts of the rest of the [[Truth Breakers]], and he nodded towards a back door, which **Borgemir** got suspicious and annoyed about, since he did not speak and had looked down on him. After some back and forth, they checked the door, and met [[Valarie River]] who where mad about the book, since it had used another cipher in parts of it. She also told that other guild members continued their own missions, with [[Nyla Thorne]] and [[Flint Varn]] working together to infiltrate the heavily guarded church.

Despite Caelum's exhaustion and agitation from his sleepless vigil, the party decided to research their mysterious enemies. While the sleep-deprived bard went to modify his crossbow into a hand crossbow, Borgemir and Luffy visited the magnificent city library called [[The Nexus]]. Their research in the grand, cathedral-like building proved illuminating. They learned that creatures capable of transforming into smoke existed and some included various undead, elementals, ghosts and vampires. The scholar they consulted grew visibly nervous upon learning the attack had occurred within the city walls, hastily excusing himself with obvious fear. Further investigation revealed crucial connections between their various encounters. The "Monsters of the World" tome explained On wights and zombies, it details that they are once humanoid creatures who have either been resurrected via necromancy, or people who have been drained and possessed via dark magic. They are often seen in cursed lands or as subordinates of powerful beings controlling dark powers. On Vampires, it is stated that they are quite rare, and haven't really been seen the last 500 years outside of their homeland in the northern wastes of the [[Azure league]]. They are very powerful beings of night. They usually create spawn and underlings to work for them as collectors or as guards for their lairs.  They also learned of some of the potential weaknesses they have, which where: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants,  
Harmed by Running Water, Stake to the Heart and Sunlight Hypersensitivity. But since these mainly taken from stories and legends, the information might not be accurate. 
Through some further quick study, they looked a bit into [[The World Maw]] and some tales from the place, mainly focused on the first layer called [[Paradise]]. Lastly **Borgemir** and **Luffy** looked after some books in private, where **Borgemir** looked for books on curses.

Which is where we ended the session.
