Continued from [[Session 9]]

## To Sutton!
Continuing from last session, the party had decided to take on a request to gather **Displacer beast** leather for **Ritz & Fitz** so they would be able to make some better equipment for the church infiltration. To gather said leather, the party started to venture north towards the small town of [[Sutton]], where the previous party had located some displacer beasts. 

After three hours traveling north from [[Everbrook]] through the countryside, the party encountered a wooden bridge crossing the river. [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]], riding in front with his magical pony, chose to inspect the bridge to ensure it was safe for their cart to cross. Looking at the bridge he noticed that, even though it had seen better days, it should be more than capable to hold the cart. But he deemed that had the weather been worse than the light rain they currently traveled trough, it might not have been as safe.  

While inspecting, [[Symph]] glided along the bridge and noticed a gnome hanging by his neck along one of the stone pillars. **Borgemir** pulled him up, and [[Caelum Aequoris]], who had kept the cart stationed just before the bridge, gave the rains to [[Luffy Longfinger]], so he could go and cast *Speak with Dead* on the body. Doing this revealed that he was a man called **Claude** and that he was killed by some masked men. They thereafter checked his body, and discovered a plain silver ring in his boot, which he stated that it was his wife's ring.
While the two were questioning the body, **Luffy** managed to muster up his courage to move the cart onto the bridge and venture onwards, but due to him never having managed a carriage before, in trying to move the horses, he startled them and they panicked onto the bridge. The two horses now barrelling forward almost crashed into, and over the bridge railing, but [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]]'s quick reactions managed to grab one of the horses and hold them, so the cart didn't fall into the river, but hit and stabilized on the railing.

After getting the cart upright again, the party ventured onwards.

## Ambush!
After some hours of travel the party noticed a camp on a hillside not long of the road. Looking from afar the camp looked like a normal camp, but [[Luffy Longfinger]] and [[Caelum Aequoris]] noticed a slight rumbling in the ground and called it out to [[Borgemir Plainsrunner]]. He then chose to ride closer on his pony to investigate, but after riding halfway there, suddenly a giant insect, with acid-dripping pincers, bursts out of the ground, and in one clean hit cut of the head of his pony, killing it in an instant. A second insect emerged as **Borgemir** tumbled free, landing gracefully with hammer drawn.

The battle was brief but intense. **Luffy**'s precise dagger work and **Caelum**'s devastating spells quickly wounded the first creature. The second monster fell to **Borgemir**'s critical hammer blow, exploding in a shower of gore and acid.

Investigating the nearby camp, they found four dead humans wearing red bandanas. The party concluded these were likely the same brigands who had attacked the wagon they'd passed earlier, now victims themselves of the subterranean predators.

## Arrival and preparations
After camping overnight without incident, **Borgemir** summoned a camel Joakim as his new magical steed. The party reached the village of [[Sutton]] after a few hours. To the northwest, Luffy spotted the blackened remains of a massive forest fire, their destination for hunting the displacer beasts. After stabling the carriage and **Borgemir**'s camel, **Caelum** went to find a inn, while **Luffy** and **Borgemir** went for a short shopping trip. **Caelum** quickly found an inn, which was run by a human woman with a teleporting dog. He negotiated a deal where they would get free food during their stay, for him playing during the evening.

After their quick shopping trip, **Borgemir** wanted to go to the church to try and lift the curse placed on him years ago. At the church him and **Luffy** met a half filled church and were able to talk to the priest after a short while. **Borgemir** told some of his story and convinced the priest to do a restoration ritual to try and cleanse him.

With the ritual triggered, **Borgemir** once again saw the memories of that night flicker through his head, but compared to the normally cloudy and unfocused images, he instead saw clear vivid images. From his hiding space under the bed, he could now clearly hear the bloody scream of his mother in the other room, and after a short while frozen in fear under the bed, he now instead of a silhouette, saw what looked like a short bulky man. The man was covered in blood spatters, which were scattered all over a velvet suit. His hands bore a dark red colour, from the immense amount of blood that covered them. As he approached the bed, **Borgemir** looking at the hands noticed how each fingernail where unnaturally long and sharp as if they where 10 small knifes plastered on his fingers. When he got to the bed, he crouched, and **Borgemir**'s face was met with a white wooden mask, carved into the shape of a bear. **Borgemir** is snapped free as the vision ends, and in his shock, he tries to reach out for the radiant flame, but sadly it does not answer. After a few tries, he connects to the flame, but it showed that even though he felt like he had regained most of the hazy memories of the night, the curse still had a grip on him.

While **Borgemir** pondered over his revelation, **Luffy** asked the priest about **The Kindling**, and where told that the church did not hold the ceremony, since it was located so close to the capital. He also informed that the next kindling would take place in a little over a month.
## The woods
Meeting up with **Caelum**, **Borgemir** shared his revelation, and the party started to venture towards the woods. At the edge of the woods they were met with a hunters lodge, where they were informed of the rules for hunting, and all fire based tools and weapons where confiscated (except the decoy duck). They where told that the hunters would take either some percentage of the prey or payments as a cost for hunting in the woods. A map of the forest and some cloaks that showed that they could hunt where given and they ventured around the woods so they could enter from the west side, to more easily get to the expected location of the displacer beasts.

The party trekked to the burnt zone's edge, wisely avoiding the ash-covered wasteland to prevent giving away their scent. After a quarter-hour skirting the devastation, they entered the deep forest. Fifteen minutes of careful stalking revealed tree markings matching the displacer beast's claw patterns.

After about 30 minutes of trekking **Luffy** spotted a dark form moving through the underbrush. Creeping closer he saw 2 sets of glowing yellow eyes. At the same time, **Caelum** heard something from behind, and turned to face another pair of glowing eyes as a black, shadowy creature lunged from hiding. The hunters had become the hunted, caught in a perfectly executed ambush as the forest erupted into violence.

Which is where the session ended.
