The campaign is centred around the rebel group called [[Truth Breakers]]. They are a group formed mainly of freedom fighters, scholars, former clergy who has seen evil in the religion and people down on their luck. They are made up of multiple "cells" that work to help uncover and tare down the regime of the [[Radiant Flame]]. The rebel group has for a long time thought that the religion is hiding something from the populace, and they have made it their goal to expose them and remove them from power. Currently the group is gearing up for a heist on the [[GoldenGlint Church]] where a mole has given them info on a ancient artifact which is to be transported here within the next couple of weeks. From what the mole has told, the artifact is of great importance to the [[Radiant Flame]] to the point that one of the [[Guardian dragons]] is set to escort it back to the city. The party will be a new cell who will be integrated into the heist, and will have to work together with the other cells to find a way to the artifact and extract it.
