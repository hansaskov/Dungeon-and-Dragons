Through the process described below,  
it is now possible for a conversion to happen  
without a direct use of a Vermilion Dihedron

By using diluted blood from one of  
The Umbral Court, combined with bella donna  
a Troll heart, Black pudding cells and Behir  
Seliva, we have been able to create  
a concoction that mimics the effects seen  
when converting using a Vermilion Dihedron.

The process seems to convert them into  
spawn from the respettable family that  
the blood comes from. Furhter testing with  
other Umbral Court members needed.  
This contradicts the Vermilion Dihedron which  
can guide the transformation to the controller’s  
wish.

Conversion time is highly affected by the  
potency of the concoction. Higher concentration  
usually creates a dud, so smaller doses are  
recomended.

The process is still rather unstable, so the  
result fluctuates alot. Main factors seem to  
be Willpower and strenght.

Further reserch is required before  
satesfactory goals are met.
