On Vampires, it is stated that they are quite rare, and haven't really been seen the last 500 years outside of their homeland in the northern wastes of the [[Azure league]]. They are very powerful beings of night. They usually create spawn and underlings to work for them as collectors or as guards for their lairs

Legends from [[The Nexus]] says that vampires are weak to Runing water, a Stake to the Heart or Direct Sunlight (Daylight Sensitivity). But since these mainly taken from stories and legends, the information might not be accurate
